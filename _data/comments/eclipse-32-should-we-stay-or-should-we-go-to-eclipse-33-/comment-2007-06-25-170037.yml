message: "<p>I'd say go for Eclipse 3.3 compatibility. One of the great things about
  open-source is that you get to upgrade your stuff pretty easily and cheaply to boot.
  Couple that with the fact that developers (i.e. your target audience) are of the
  adventurous kind anyway and I think it becomes a no-brainer.</p>"
