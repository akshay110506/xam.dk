message: <p>Go with Eclipse-3.3 and WTP-2.0 if RHT has to pick one.  Eclipse-3.2 and
  WTP-1.5 will be put into "maintenance mode" soon enough.</p><p>Perhaps have two
  versions?  One for 3.2/1.5 and the other for 3.3/2.0.  This only seems feasible
  if the code for 3.2/1.5 can be generated from the 3.3/2.0-compatible source, and/or
  the divergence between 3.2/1.5-compatibility and 3.3/2.0-compatibility ends up being
  quite small.</p><p>I think the value in supporting two versions is the greatest
  upon the launch of JBoss Tools/RHDS proper.  As Eclipse-3.2.x and its Web Tools
  Platform-1.5.x will have the largest degree of market penetration -- relative to
  3.3/2.0 -- at that point in time, which should decrease as time passes.  (And JBoss
  Tools/RHDS itself could be a vigorous driver of 3.3/2.0 adoption.)</p><p>But if
  JBoss Tools requires inquisitive adopters to either scrap their current Eclipse
  instance, or install a parallel instance, that could be a turn off as well.  (This
  could be ameliorated by offering a "ready-mix" version of JBT for download, as was
  common while the old-school JBossIDE had regular releases.)  Plus, JBoss Tools could
  risk being a Europa-only "island" if the rest of the Eclipse-plugin ecosystem takes
  its sweet time moving from Callisto to Europa.</p><p>That said, I concur with JS
  above, Europa will certainly have Teh Shiny(tm) factor, as will RHMW's tooling offerings.  It
  also gives JBoss Tools/Red Hat Developer Studio (RHDS) a competitive advantage over
  offerings from other firms.</p>
