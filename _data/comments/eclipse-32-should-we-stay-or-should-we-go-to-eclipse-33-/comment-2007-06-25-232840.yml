  some of the API we depend on - It could be done technically but would require a
  massive amount of extra testing ;(</p><p>With respect to a full single easy to use
  download then that is what Red Hat Developer Studio will provide.</p><p>Remember
  that when Eclipse 3.3 comes out there will be one single download of it make the
  installation much easier and then adding our plugins should become a breeze (especially
