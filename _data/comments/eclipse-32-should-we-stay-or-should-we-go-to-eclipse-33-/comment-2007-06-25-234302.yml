message: <p>"[W]hen Eclipse 3.3 comes out there will be one single download of it
  make the installation much easier"</p><p>I didn't know that.  Cool!  Then by all
  means, 3.3/2.0-only.  If 3.2/1.5 compatibility is required, then the community can
  backport.  (And yes, I know this is a lame "catch-all" excuse.)</p>
