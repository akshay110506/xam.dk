message: "<p>Hi,</p><p>If the problem occurs when you are running the JBoss apache
  server perspective then the problem is not related to the eclipse.ini settings.
  When you first add your server you will have to define the JDK to be used and it
  is here that you can set the -Xms and -Xmx (and PermGen) settings for the chosen
  JVM. Each server runs in it's own JVM and can be configured in isolation to the
  eclipse javaw process.</p><p>Hope this helps someone :)</p><p>Steve K</p>"
