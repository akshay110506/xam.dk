message: <p>Hi Xam,</p><p>Subject - .ini file name must match the .exe file name and<br
  />not all versions of eclipse require separate lines for .ini.</p><p>Thanks for
  the info - it was great.  I am running Eclipse Ganymede version 3.4.2 on a Windows
  XP box.  The command line solution worked great for me but when I tried to add the
  commands to my eclipse.ini file they were never picked up - verifying the changes
  were made the way you indicate in your helpful solution.  As it turns out I had
  changed the name of my eclipse.exe file to eclipse-3.4.2.exe.  Thus, per</p><p><a

  init parameters will be read from a corresponding .ini file called eclipse-3.4.2.ini
  or you can specify a particular file name using the command</p><p>--launcher.ini
  &lt;location&gt; (Executable) NEW<br />    the location of the product .ini file
  to use.  If not specified the executable will look for a file beside the launcher
  with the same name and the extension .ini.  (ie eclipse.exe looks for eclipse.ini,
  product.exe looks for product.ini)</p><p>So, when I made this change and started
  Eclipse nothing happened - eclipse did not start up at all (my file had the commands
  on separate lines as you indicate in your solution).  I changed my .ini file to
  be on one line and wham - Eclipse started just fine and the init parameter I had
  set in the .ini file were read in just fine.</p>
