message: <p>I had a problem about OutOfMemoryError because of the Eclipse and I read
  this article but the suggest didn't solve. I found another solution in the net and
  I am going to share with you.<br />On Eclipse select the menu Window&gt;&gt;Preferences&gt;&gt;Java&gt;&gt;Installed
  JREs</p><p>Select the version that you use and click on the button Edit</p><p>In
  field "Default VM Arguments" put for example:<br />-Xms512m -Xmx1g</p>
