message: "<p>I really wonder why these problems started with me now that I'm using
  windows 7, last week with Windows XP I had no problems at all (I got 2GB of Ram
  - before opening Eclipse I have 1GB free ) and this Eclipse WTP of mine is just
  the same as the other one (Copied and pasted the its folder), besides I got stupid
  projects in it, I mean, just have training and basic stuff so no real projects to
  cause such problems.</p><p>* Using the lastest JDK though</p>"
