message: "<p>I've written a JAAS system for my current contract. IMO you need to implement
  you're own Policy subclass to do it properly. This is because the standard policy
  file based implementation isn't very useful because of it's static nature. Then
  you can do whatever you want. I've implemented the getPermissions abstract method
  to return a collection of custom permissions from the db. Within the permissions,
  you can do whatever you like.</p>"
