message: <p>Les, that is all fine and dandy - and that  all relates to &lt;b&gt;authentication&lt;/b&gt;
  which is more or less straight forward. <br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />The problem
  is that I need &lt;b&gt;non-basic authorization&lt;/b&gt;, meaning that a simple
  "isInRole()" call is NOT enough! <br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />I need something
  like .checkPermission(new  MedicatePermission("department X", "patient Y", "drug
  Z", "10 o'clock")); which should dynamically check up against the current state
  of the system wether the current Subject is allowed to perform a medication on department
  X, regarding Patient Y with the Drug Z at 10 o'clock. This is not very easy to do
  with any realm or policy implementation I've seen.<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />But
  thanks for your comments anyway ;)</p>
