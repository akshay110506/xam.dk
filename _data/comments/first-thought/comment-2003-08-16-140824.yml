message: "<p>HI Xam,<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />what you can do is implement your
  permission with two constructor one protected which takes all the argument you mentioned
  and another which is pulic and takes only name and action. <br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />When AccessController is checking the permission. It will create a permission
  with your public constructor and pass it the permission you have created in policy
  collection in it's implies method. you can typecast the permission into your Class
  and do whatever check you want based on the internal state of your permission.<br
  /><br /></p><p><br /><br />only problem is you will also have to provide your own
  Policy implementation.<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />I am also working on the similar
  problem, i have managed to get authentication to group/role based permissions (users
  and groups defined in MySQL database), now i am writing PolicyDB which is an implementation
  of <br /><br /><br />Policy based on permissions defined in DB.<br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />let me know you want to see my code of authentication, and i can give you
  authorization code once i complete it.</p>"
