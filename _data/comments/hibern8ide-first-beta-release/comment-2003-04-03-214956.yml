message: '<p>Hello,<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />I''ve just had a look to your HSQL
  interpreter and its background looks pretty good.<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />I''m
  actually developing a tool that in some way administrates the BBDD form  Hibernate
  by using a relational object explorer where such objects,collections and mapping
  entities can be created, modified or removed. They can be dynamically loaded as
  it is your case, and I will be developing the functionality soon.<br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />To be completly honest, this is my first serious project involing internet,
  so I''m a bit mixed up. I would like to use your code (if it is Opensource) in order
  to add it to my tool or I could take part in the development of the interpreter
  by adding part of my application. I''m not sure about how to do this: do I have
  to do it through "SourceForge" using Hibernate Forum or do I have to comment it
  right to you?.</p>'
