message: "<p>Hi there,</p><p>Your blog has clarified a lot to me! It was basically
  the only one which explains how to check whether the vmargs were read or not by
  Eclipse.</p><p>So, despite all my changes on eclipse.ini, on Help-&gt;About-&gt;Configuration
  I still read eclipse.vmargs=-jar. Even running eclipse by command line (using the
  example you gave) keep generating the same result, as if it's ignoring the vmargs
  no matter what.</p><p>I eliminated all the empty lines and blank spaces, I tried
  to put the options in a different order, etc. It simply keeps ignoring. Concerning
  the Eclipse bug#198823, I believe is not the case here, because I'm working under
  Linux (openSuse) all the time - therefore eclipse.ini was never edited under Windows.</p><p>So,
  my doubt is: all your comments and instructions are only valid for Eclipse under
  Windows? Can it be that Eclipse is actually reading the ini file though I can't
  confirm it via Help-&gt;About...?</p><p>Thanks.<br />Aryen</p>"
