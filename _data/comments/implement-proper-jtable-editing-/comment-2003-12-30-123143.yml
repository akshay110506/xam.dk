message: <p>Guys - have you an example of that code ?<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br
  />I have done stuff similar to that but I could never make it work reliable - especially
  not if you got special document handling and stuff...it grows even worse with JFormatedTextField
  which don't even have a document to insert/remove "keys" from....and what if it
  is a special character/functionkey you pressed...what do you do then ?<br /><br
  /></p><p><br /><br />The "bug" is thate the key get to the component before it get's
  its focus...that should not be allowed to happen ;(</p>
