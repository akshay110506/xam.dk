message: "<p>As one of the developers of Hibernate :), I can promise you that Hibernate
  is NOT depending on using runtime bytecode generation to access fields inside an
  object. (the runtime bytecode gen is mostly for performance and to realize lazyloading)<br
  /><br /></p><p><br /><br />Hibernate uses Reflection to access PROPERTIES - not
  fields. Direct field access have actually only been made available lately, before
  we only accessed properties (public, protected, private whatever ;)<br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />But putting that aside - I refrain from making the event listeners part
  of my public interface of my gui classes...thus I use inner anonymous classes....and
  thus i'm also very much considering using EventHandler ;)<br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />...but i don't follow your argument saying that having inner classes tightly
  couples the gui to the model ?</p>"
