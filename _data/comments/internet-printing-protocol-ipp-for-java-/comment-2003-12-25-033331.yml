message: <p>Do you have a link to the article ?<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />But
  your small resume indicate to me that i do not agree on his viewpoints ;) <br /><br
  /><br />I normally disagree with people saying that the objectmodels should have
  a "getPresentation()" method or similar...that simply does not work .... most of
  the time i see gui much like persistence, it is something orthogonal on the domain
  - something that is best "externalized" and modelled in its own right.<br /><br
  /></p><p><br /><br />And yes - if Holub write about objects having their own presentation
  then i do understand what you mean about strong coupling...and that is bad ;)</p>
