message: <p>There is no solution for the public v. private issue.  Its a side effect
  of the security restrictions placed on reflection.  Reflection can not invoke a
  method unless the class that's doing the invoking is doing it within the appropriate
  scope, so even package-protected things have to be invoked in the same package.<br
  /><br /></p><p><br /><br />Trouble is the invoker in this case belongs to java.beans,
  not to the package of your gui code.  There's simply no way around that unless the
  JDK opens up more aspects of the .classfile, and that opens up a larger can of worms
  that I'd really rather not deal with.<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />Besides, IMHO,
  if something can be called via the GUI, its "public", and thus the method that invokes
  it on my Object should also be public.  Its part of what something from the outside
  can do to my object.  By having it public, it also gives me the room to test it
  with external testing tools.<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />As one noted, one could
  instead advertise what actions are available by making public an array of Action
  objects.<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />With the stack-trace, that was just plain
  bad, although my version had the same issue.  The trouble in that case is the general
  problem of dispatching Exceptions in any GUI program.  If you can't catch them,
  they propagate up to the AWT event queue, where they'll be printStackTraced anyways,
  and in the case of InvocationException (written before JDK 1.4 built-in nested exceptions)
  the real source of the problem may end up not displayed in the dump.<br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />Really, in any framework for a GUI, one should have the means to add an
  ExceptionHandler type of Object to deal with that sort of thing, but the JDK didn't
  build it in.</p>
