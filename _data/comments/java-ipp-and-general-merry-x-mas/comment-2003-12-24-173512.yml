message: <p>Joe, that is not true - otherwise persitenceengines and many J2EE servers
  or other highly reflection based systems (such as Hibernate) would be living on
  a lie ;)<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />Yes - there is some security breachees, but
  in general it is possible to call also private and protected methods via reflection.<br
  /><br /></p><p><br /><br />Yes - i'm al for it being public on e.g. anonymous inner
  classes, but the AIC's just fills up to much compared to what they provide. And
  often they just relay the event to a protected method in the outer-class....thus
  using EventHandler or similar would allow me to express what I actually do in much
  less code.<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />Regarding AWT exceptions there is an ExceptionHandler
  object. Look for "sun.awt.exception.handler" via google.</p>
