message: "<p>Why couldn't I find anything like this when I was searching for a solution?
  The only thing I came up was the vertical-separator, which helped a bit (when using
  default fonts).... Thanks a lot!</p><p>BTW, When I tried to apply the vertical-separator
  setting to GTKWidget, gnome started acting really weird (I couldn't restart it using
  ctrl-alt-backspace)... I'll definitely try your theme once I get a working notebook
  back :-)</p>"
