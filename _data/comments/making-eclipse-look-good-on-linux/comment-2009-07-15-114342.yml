message: "<p>I honestly don't understand folks who prefer the cluttered Windows appearance
  and the blocky, tiny ass fonts. Really, after you switch to Fedora and learn to
  live without the straitjacket, your eyes really thank you for it.</p><p>Granted,
  the default Fedora fonts are too big. However, once you set the font size to 10,
  the resolution to 96 ppi and install the freetype-freeworld package (a true jewel
  available from the RPM fusion repos), everything looks fantastic. Recent Ubuntu
  distros (Jaunty for sure) come with freetype-freeworld (which has patent issues)
  preinstalled, so you can enjoy the crisp fonts out of the box.</p>"
