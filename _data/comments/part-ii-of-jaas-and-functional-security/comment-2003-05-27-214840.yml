message: "<p>In most servlet or J2EE books (or even tomcat documentation) you will
  find the Realm portion documented pretty well. This will let you define multiple
  roles per principle.  It does, however, leave it up to you how you validate those
  roles against your functionality.  However, it is pretty easy to create a role to
  function table in the database.  (BTW, there are DataSourceRealms and JDBCRealms
  that come with most app servers - even tomcat).  So, you should be able to keep
  all of your data there.  <br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />I didn't read your first
  entry...but, I hope that this helps with this one.</p>"
