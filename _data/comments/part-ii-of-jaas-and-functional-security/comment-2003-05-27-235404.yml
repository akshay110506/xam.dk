message: "<p>OK...well here is what I am missing.  Are you looking for something in
  JAAS that provides the .checkPermission method for you??  If so, you won't find
  it.  I think that the most you can expect from JAAS is who am I and what are my
  roles (you can, btw, get all of the roles for the current user).  So, you have to
  write your framework that can take a MedicatePermission Object and determine if
  the current user's roles (as currently in the database) are sufficient.  It shouldn't
  be too hard to write. <br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />EJB does provide you with method
  level role association, but I think this is a very narrow security model.  I do
  think that OpenSymphony has an entitlement engine (OSAccess, I think).  It may do
  more of what you want.  <br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />Anyway, my point is that
  JAAS will do authentication, but it only does part of the authorization.  The rest
  is pretty much custom.  I think that this is because JAAS was designed with EJB.
  \ So, it was not until later that it became it's own framework.  As a result, half
  of it is in JAAS and half in EJB...for what it's worth. :)<br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />Anyway, check out OSAccess and let me know if it is useful (I havn't looked
  at it much).</p>"
