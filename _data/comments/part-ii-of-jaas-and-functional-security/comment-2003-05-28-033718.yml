message: "<p>xam - you have it correct.  You will need to implement your MedicatePermission
  Permission but everything else is provided for you.  Sun even provides a GUI to
  create your own policy files (although only the JDK 1.4.x versions are aware of
  Prinicpals).<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />If the default PolicyFile implementation
  isn't good enough, you can implement a Policy class that hits a database.  I did
  one recently that updates itself every 30 minutes.  A more elegant solution might
  be a Policy that subscribes to JMS Topic to be notified of policy updates.<br /><br
  /></p><p><br /><br />By the way, I have always felt that the call to java.security.AccessController.checkPermission(Permission)
  and the Subject.doAs stuff just begged to be done as XDoclet tags.  Then you could
  have something like<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />/**<br /><br /><br /> * @security
  require com.me.MedicatePermission<br /><br /><br /> */<br /><br /><br />public void
  medicate(){<br /><br /><br />   morphine++<br /><br /><br />}<br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />Nice clean code.  Declarative security.  This is how .NET does it.</p>"
