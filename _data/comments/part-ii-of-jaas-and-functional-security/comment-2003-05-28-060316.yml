message: <p>xam - is what matt gives an example of what you want??  From what I gathered
  you wanted something dynamic, not declarative (per the .net example above).  If
  that is what you want,  ignore all of my previous comments because clearly I had
  it wrong.  I thought that you wanted a credential check that's results could vary
  both on the role of the user and the underlying state of the functional or data
  components. Is this corrent?   In other words, .checkPermisions(new MedicatePermission("morphine"....)
  == true if current nurse is certified, there is a heart specialist on duty, the
  patient has only had x amount, etc.  If this is the case you should also really
  look at a rules engine.  Since it sounds like this is as much business logic as
  it is security.</p>
