message: '<p>Great comments ;)<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />Les first: Yes, i''m
  well aware that JAAS won''t "deduce"/"calculate" wether the current actually got
  the permisson or not. For that I''ll need my own Policy/Permission implementation
  based on either code, magic, rules or whatever. But I really like the JAAS API,
  it has all the correct ingredients, and i''m basically just looking for documentation
  on how to implement such a best without interfeering (or rather how to integrate
  it) with the default implememntation/behavior.<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />And
  Matt: Yes, the policytool is there, but it does not scale well and the declaritive
  security in .net/J2EE just seems way to simple for my needs. I can for the life
  of me not see how I can based on just a simple role e.g. "nurse" can declare that
  she is not allowed to call "medicate()" ......because she can, if she has been given
  the right permissions - and that the timing/data is correct.......<br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />But thanks for the comments - I now know that I''m on the right "path" I
  just need to find (or try to make a full example my own) of a good Policy/Permission
  set that can integrate well with JAAS, J2EE <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fet.al%3A6aezp-d7g56f8yLXypu0pTCfKjA&amp;cuid=1582918"
