message: "<p>What if I want more sophistication with the way roles are handled. I
  want to group roles into capabilities and assign subjects/princples/users/whatever
  they are called to this capability (a group of roles). For example a manager has
  role - a,b,c,d&amp;e. A developer has role d,e,f,g&amp;h. when I create a manager
  instead of assigning him to 5 roles I assign him 1 capability &amp; he gets linked
  to 5 roles. Then I shud be able to check from the app/code if he has role -'e'.
  I know this should be possible but how to go about doing this? Any pointers to this?</p>"
