message: "<p>I'm looking for something quite similar. In our system we'll have:<br
  /><br /></p><p><br /><br />System, clients, projects and projectdata.<br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />there are roles that apply Systemwide, clientwide or per project.<br /><br
  /></p><p><br /><br />I read the IBM document and it does encapsulate most of th
  erequired functionality, but what I'm missing is the information that when replace
  the security policy file if all the system policies that you usually set in there
  need to conform the new format, because I was thinking of integrating all the permissions
  for te different roles into a database for easy management as well as the user-role-target
  relationships (eg user(john)-role(admin)-target(clienty\\projectx).<br /><br /></p><p><br
  /><br />I've looked everywhere but I'm slowly sinking in the quicksand surrounding
  this API, there is a little bit of info everywhere, but there seems to be no real
  useful reference.</p>"
