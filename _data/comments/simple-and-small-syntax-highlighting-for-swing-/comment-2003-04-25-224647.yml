message: '<p>1. It inherits from JComponent instead of JTextComponent (if it did it
  would help a great deal)<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />2. It swollows all keyevents,
  making it impossible to install a shortcut in a menu and having the JEditArea react
  to it ;(<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />3. It installs it''s own Scrollbars! That
  is a big sin in my book ... what the heck is wrong with new JScrollPane(new JEditTextArea())
  ?<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />4. because of 1-3 I have to "work-around" the component
  to make it "behave" ...and me don''t like that ;)<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />That
  is just the ones i can come up with from memory ;)<br /><br /></p><p><br /><br />...and
  i hate that the javadocs says: "It is also faster [then JEditorPane] and doesn''t
  have as many problems" ....without saying why it is faster and which problems the
  swing components have....</p>'
