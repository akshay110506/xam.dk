I was looking for a way to convert Google documents to https://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc].

In that search I learned about https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoc-processor/eghlmnhjljbjodpeehjjcgfcjegcfbhk?hl=en[AsciiDoc Processor] which "kind of" works, but have two big issues: I cannot use it on
my Google Apps domain that do no allow Google Add Ons and it did not handle images nor tables.

Thus I started looking for another solution.

Here I found https://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md[gdocs2md] which
converts to MarkDown which is close enough and it was just a script I
could use on Google App Domain. Even more awesome is that it supports
basic tables and images. It still had some issues but I noticed this
project has a tons of https://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md/pulls[pull
requests] and that lead me to
https://github.com/jacksonicson/gdocs2md[jacksonicson/gdocs2md] which
fixes a tons of the bugs.

After a bit of figuring out the logic I modified and extended this to
convert to AsciiDoc instead of markdown.

The result is https://github.com/maxandersen/gdoc2adoc[gdoc2adoc].

With this you just put in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxandersen/gdoc2adoc/master/converttoasciidoc.gapps[this code] into your script editor and run
the conversion via the now added `AsciiDoc` menu.

The result can either be mailed to you as a zip or created as a `<original name>.adoc` folder in you google drive.

You can see details on how to use it in the https://github.com/maxandersen/gdoc2adoc/blob/master/README.adoc[README].

I've been using it on a bunch of documents and found it useful.

Now sharing it with the world and if you find documents that is not converted well do open an https://github.com/maxandersen/gdoc2adoc/issues[issue] or even better a https://github.com/maxandersen/gdoc2adoc/pulls[pull request].

Enjoy!
