Today I noticed via http://onethingwell.org that there is now a native Git client for iOS. 

The client is called http://workingcopyapp.com[Working Copy] and is available in the App Store. 

I'm actually writing this blog post in it right now as a test.

It even supports uploading photos.

Once I commit (free) and push (needs app purchase) A Travis build is triggered that should result in Awestruct rendering and publishing this nice blog. 

What is great by working copy is that it integrates with iOS 8 new feature of sharing and editing services so you can use it from and with any app. 

Making it very interesting for on the go blogging and quick fixes.
