<div><p>I'm searching for a lightweight SMTP implementation that is NOT dependent on JavaMail....particularly i'm looking for it to have a lightweight mailAppender for Log4j.<br><br>
I can find EasySMTP referenced a couple of places but the <a href="http://www.bitfolge.de/easysmtp/">site</a> seems dead and it is also GPL which makes it impossible for me to use ;(</p></div>
