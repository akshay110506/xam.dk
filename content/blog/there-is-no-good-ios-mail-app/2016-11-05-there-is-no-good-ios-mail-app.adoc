= There is no great iOS mail client app

Every now and then I find me going through the various 3rd party email apps on iOS to see if there is an app that is actually great.

Thus far, no. There is no great iOS mail client app available.

In my mind to be a great mail app for a phone there are some features that must be present and some nice-to-have:

== Must haves

Quoting when composing::
When replying to emails it is important to keep it short and on topic. Best way I know of doing that when someone sent you a list of questions or observations are to use quoting. Quoting is what allow you and the sender to see the context of your reply.

Mail clients that does this: iOS native.

Mail clients that does *NOT* do this: Spark, Dispatch, Outlook

Swipes with Actions::
Swipes is a great way to quickly swift through your email and perform certain actions like "Mark as read", "Archive", "Snooze" etc. but what really makes an mail app great is when you can customize one or more actions on your mail. For example I'm a heavy 2do app user and I would like to swipe on a mail to send it directly to my 2Do inbox - optimally even be asked what list to add it to.

Smart folder navigation::
With 200-400 mails on average pr. day I automatically sort mails into folders to avoid overloading my inbox. Meaning I have many folders - a great mail app should understand that and let me navigate to folders fast. Just showing me a mile long tree list of folders are not enough.

Smart focused/search folders::
In a day, making it really hard to process all - especially on a mobile device. I use "Focused inbox" features but they tend to only look in Inbox and not in my folders. I would prefer being able to setup a set of criterias and have that saved as a folder I can go to quickly to see if there are anything relevant for me.

== Nice to have

Password manager integration::
Setting up or updating your settings for one or mail account can be really tedious on a phone. Mail clients should have 1Password and/or LastPass integration to speed that up. For mail app writers seeing this you can use https://github.com/joelastpass/generic-password-app-extension[this code] to enable it for both 1Password and LastPass.

Smart search notifications::
I generally hate email notifications, but that is mainly because mail apps tend to want to notify me about everything or nothing. Some clients have notifications for certain people (marked as VIP), but just because you are VIP and post a mail in a mailing list I'm casually following does not mean I want to be notified. Instead if the mail app could be told to only notify me when a list of conditions matches like `author in (VIP) and (to/cc contains @me or list-id in (lists I follow))`  then it would super useful. Otherwise it is just a noice generator.


Overview of features in table form. To be a Great client you must have no zero's.

App, Quoting, Action on swipe, Folder navigation, Smart folders, Password Manager, Smart Notification, Total
Apple,    3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2 out of 5
Outlook,  0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2 out of 5
Spark,    0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 5 out of 6
Dispatch, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2 out of 6
GMail,    3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2 out of 6

Which client do I use ? Apple's. Purely of the reason that it supports quoting when composing (A *must* have) and it does not feel clunky like Google GMail app does.

Which client would I use next: Spark if it fixed its quoting and if it could learn Dispatch's action integration which is just faster/smarter.
